  title: Léargon API
  description: 'REST API for Léargon data and process governance platform.


    ## Authentication

    The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. After logging in or signing up, you will receive an access token
    that must be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for protected endpoints.


    ## Authorization Roles

    - **ROLE_USER**: Standard user role, assigned to all users by default

    - **ROLE_ADMIN**: Administrative role with full user management capabilities


    ## Fallback Administration Protection

    The system includes a fallback admin user that cannot be modified or deleted through the API. Any attempt to modify this
    user will result in a 403 Forbidden response.
