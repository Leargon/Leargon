 * Léargon API
 * REST API for Léargon data and process governance platform.

## Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. After logging in or signing up, you will receive an access token that must be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for protected endpoints.

## Authorization Roles
- **ROLE_USER**: Standard user role, assigned to all users by default
- **ROLE_ADMIN**: Administrative role with full user management capabilities

## Fallback Administration Protection
The system includes a fallback admin user that cannot be modified or deleted through the API. Any attempt to modify this user will result in a 403 Forbidden response.
